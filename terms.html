      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>Last updated: November 5, 2025

      <h3>Acceptance</h3>
      <p>By using StockGenie, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p>For the purposes of these Terms:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>"App"</strong> means the StockGenie application and any associated mobile or web client code authored by the provider.</li>
    <li><strong>"Provider"</strong> means the developer or operator of StockGenie (see app listing for contact/jurisdiction information).</li>
    <li><strong>"User"</strong> means an individual who installs, accesses, or uses the App.</li>
    <li><strong>"Services"</strong> means the features and functionality provided by the App (on-device OCR, split calculations, export features, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>"Store"</strong> means the platform store through which the App is distributed (for example, Apple App Store or Google Play).</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Scope and purpose</h3>
  <p>StockGenie provides on-device tools to scan receipts, extract totals and help split payments between people. All OCR and model inference occur on the user's device. The provider does not host or process receipt images or parsed receipt data on a server as part of normal operation. It is a convenience tool — final verification of any financial data is the user's responsibility.</p>

      <h3>User responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: Receipt scanning uses OCR and machine learning. Results may be incorrect. Users must review and confirm all extracted values before relying on them.</li>
        <li>Liability: You are responsible for the correctness of any data entered, verified, or exported from the app.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Termination and service availability</h3>
    <p>The Provider may, at its sole discretion, suspend, restrict, or discontinue access to the App or any portion of the Services at any time and for any reason, including for breach of these Terms or misuse. The Provider is not liable to you or any third party for any suspension or discontinuation of the App.</p>

    <h3>Indemnification</h3>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Provider and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.</p>

    <h3>Age restrictions</h3>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use the App. If local law requires a higher minimum age in your jurisdiction (for example 16), you must be at least that age to use the App without parental consent.</p>

    <h3>Governing law and jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Illinois, United States</strong>. Any dispute arising under or related to these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Illinois, United States. If you prefer a different jurisdiction, update the contact/jurisdiction information in the app listing accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the provider (the developer/operator of FairShare) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, revenue, data or goodwill arising out of or relating to the use of the app.</p>

      <p>In particular, the provider is not responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorrect OCR results or parsing errors that lead to financial discrepancies;</li>
        <li>User mistakes in accepting or editing parsed receipts;</li>
        <li>Any third-party services (payment providers, payment processors) integrated by the user.</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Purchases</h3>
  <p>Any in-app purchases are processed through the platform's store (for example, Apple App Store or Google Play). The provider does not collect or aggregate individual purchase receipts; reporting available to the developer from the store is standard, aggregated store reporting and is not under the provider's control. The provider does not host or retain user receipt images or parsed receipt data on a server.</p>

      <h3>Governing law</h3>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the developer's country of residence (see app listing). If any provision is found invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>

      <h3>No legal advice</h3>
      <p>These terms are a template and do not constitute legal advice. Please consult an attorney for binding terms tailored to your jurisdiction.</p>

  <h3>Updates to these terms</h3>
  <p>The Provider may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version in the App and on the publicly published Terms page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h3>Contacts and syncing</h3>
  <p>The App may provide an optional contacts import or sync feature to make assigning people to receipt items easier. Contacts access is only used with your explicit permission and any imported contacts are stored locally on your device. The Provider does not transmit or retain your contact data on a server as part of normal operation. If you choose to export or sync contacts to third-party services, that action is performed by you and is outside the Provider's control.</p>
